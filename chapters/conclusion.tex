\chapter{Conclusion}
DCNNs have shown great ability to do dense predictions of semantic labels in images with accuracy up to 86.9\% on the VOC2012 dataset. Huge datasets have been made for the training of these nets and data availability seems to be the biggest factor in success nowadays, but recent approaches such as CapsNet try to lower the demand for data.

With the performance seen in the results of the DCNNs reviewed in this paper, there is no reason to believe that they should not be able to vectorize the zoning regulations as proposed. However, one of the biggest challenges found in this paper is the need to create a specific dataset. As seen in \autoref{chp:dataset} there is no simple way to know the location of the zoning area within the PDF, so a procedure needs to be done in order to fully automate the creation of the training dataset. This needs to be investigated further in order to draw a conclusion regarding the feasibility of making such dataset.

If such dataset is created, the work proposed in this paper could greatly speed up the process of vectorizing old zoning regulations by automating the whole process. Automation could yield substantial economic savings and an effort should be given to evaluating different methods in order to do so.
