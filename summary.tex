\section*{Abstract}
Old scanned zoning regulations are currently being vectorized using manual techniques. With the recent advances in image recognition and semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks, there should be a possibility to use them for automatic vectorization of the regulations thus, lowering the cost and time spent doing manual work.

This paper gives an overview of the state-of-the-art regarding image segmentation using convolutional networks and vectorization techniques for automatic vectorization of raster maps. We also look at how the dataset needed to train such networks can be automatically created by using already vectorized zoning regulations and highlight possible problems with this approach.

conclusion also maybe?
