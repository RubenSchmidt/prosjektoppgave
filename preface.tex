This paper is the results of the specialization project TBA4560 as part of the study program Engineering and ICT with specialization in Geomatics. The project was conducted fall 2018 in cooperation with Spacemaker, a company that works with AI technology to maximize the value of building sites. 

The project has given the author a thourough look at the state-of-the-art regarding automatic vectorization of raster maps using traditional approaches and deep convolutional networks that will serve as the basis for a master thesis in spring 2018.
